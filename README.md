<h3>fb-enc, a Facebook privacy-enhancing Chrome browser extension</h3>

fb-enc is a Chrome browser extension that gives users in a group the ability to encrypt Facebook posts as well as automatically decrypt others' Facebook posts. This technical implementation was part of an honors thesis completed at Oberlin College in 2021, the result of which is [this paper](Honors_Paper.pdf). The extension uses AES-256 in CBC mode to encrypt a user's text post, allowing them to instead post a 'dummy text', which in turn is automatically replaced in the page by the actual post for other users by the extension running in the background. It uses Google Firebase to store the actual ciphertexts of posts, which the extension retrieves using the dummy text, decrypts, and provides back to the user. Full details of the implementation as well as context into the background of the study it was used in and its results can be found in the [final paper](Honors_Paper.pdf). This implementation was created as a proof of concept and for the purpose of conducting the study, it is not intended for any other use.
